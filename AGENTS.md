# Notes for AI agents (and humans) working on this plugin

## Never work on the live plugin

The copy installed at `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/gusthx.weather/` is the one the user's Omarchy
shell is running. Saving a file there hot-reloads the plugin in the user's bar, and
`omarchy restart shell` restarts the whole bar. Doing that over and over while developing
is disruptive.

- **Edit only this repository** (the working copy in `~/Work/`).
- **Do not** edit, copy into, or `git` anything under `~/.config/omarchy/plugins/`.
- **Do not** run `omarchy restart shell`, `omarchy refresh shell`, `omarchy theme set`,
  or IPC calls (`omarchy-shell gusthx.weather ...`) to test a change.
- **Do not** take screenshots of the user's desktop (`grim`) to check your work.

## Test in isolation

Run the plugin's QML in a **separate** Quickshell instance that never touches the running
shell: make a throwaway config dir with symlinks to Omarchy's libraries and this repo, plus
a small `shell.qml` that shows the component you are working on.

```bash
cfg="$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/gusthx.weather-dev"; rm -rf "$cfg"; mkdir -p "$cfg"
ln -s /usr/share/omarchy/shell/Commons "$cfg/Commons"
ln -s /usr/share/omarchy/shell/Ui "$cfg/Ui"
ln -s "$PWD" "$cfg/plugin"
# write $cfg/shell.qml: ShellRoot { PanelWindow { ... import "plugin" as P ... } }
quickshell -n -p "$cfg/shell.qml"
```

For screenshots, draw on a background layer (`WlrLayershell.layer: WlrLayer.Background`,
`keyboardFocus: None`) and save with `item.grabToImage(r => r.saveToFile(path))`, then
`Qt.quit()`. A full working example is `dev/` in
[omarchy-agents-pet](https://github.com/gusthanks/omarchy-agents-pet).

Also run `omarchy plugin validate .`. What can't be rendered in isolation (live data in
the real bar) is checked by the user after deploying, not by you on their live shell.

## Deploy only at the end, and only when asked

When the change is finished, tested and committed, update the installed copy once (the
shell hot-reloads it). Never use `omarchy refresh shell` (it resets the bar layout).
